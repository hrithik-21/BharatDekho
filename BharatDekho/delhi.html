        <H2><font color="red">AIR POLLUTION</font></H2>

        <P>estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people in Delhi every year.During 2013–14, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) in Delhi increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states.Delhi has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms.Rising air pollution level has significantly increased lung-related ailments (especially asthma and lung cancer) among Delhi's children and women.He dense smog in Delhi during winter season results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year.According to Indian meteorologists, the average maximum temperature in Delhi during winters has declined notably since 1998 due to rising air pollution.
Dense smog blankets Connaught Place, Delhi.

Environmentalists have criticised the Delhi government for not doing enough to curb air pollution and to inform people about air quality issues.Most of Delhi's residents are unaware of alarming levels of air pollution in the city and the health risks associated with it;however, as of 2015, awareness, particularly among the foreign diplomatic community and high-income Indians, was noticeably increasing.Since the mid-1990s, Delhi has undertaken some measures to curb air pollution – Delhi has the third highest quantity of trees among Indian cities and the Delhi Transport Corporation operates the world's largest fleet of environmentally friendly compressed natural gas (CNG) buses.In 1996, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) started a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court of India that ordered the conversion of Delhi's fleet of buses and taxis to run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and banned the use of leaded petrol in 1998. In 2003, Delhi won the United States Department of Energy's first 'Clean Cities International Partner of the Year' award for its "bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives".The Delhi Metro has also been credited for significantly reducing air pollutants in the city.</P>

There are 70 assembly constituencies and seven Lok Sabha (Indian parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi.The Indian National Congress (Congress) formed all the governments in Delhi until the 1990s, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Madan Lal Khurana, came to power.In 1998, the Congress returned to power under the leadership of Sheila Dikshit, who was subsequently re-elected for 3 consecutive terms. But in 2013, the Congress was ousted from power by the newly formed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led by Arvind Kejriwal forming the government with outside support from the Congress.However, that government was short-lived, collapsing only after 49 days.Delhi was then under President's rule till February 2015.On 10 February 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party returned to power after a landslide victory, winning 67 out of the 70 seats in the Delhi Legislative Assembly.</P>
